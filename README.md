Orientation Analysis Tools: Add-In for ArcMap 10.2
Add-In for ArcMap 10.2. Orientation analysis tools for tectonic data processing in the mapping environment of ArcGIS. These tools enable to plot orientations into diagram (azimuthal projection â€“ equal-area net) as points or great circles, count the density distribution diagrams, map of spatial averages, map of fold axes or a rose histogram). Link Tool connects data in the diagram and the map. Profile Tool was added to create profile line of cross section from dmr. Several additional functions are available (eigenvectors, vector calculator). As a result you can get an overview of main structures in the map, to accompany your map with diagrams and enjoy working in a single environment with no need of data transfer.

Installation guide, add-in guide and sample data (tecto_Pulk.shp) are uploaded. Diagram_outline.shp is the outline of the projection for Plot in Azimuthal Projection tool, Density Distribution Diagram and Rose Histogram.
